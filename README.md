# Spanish-English-NMT-Transformer

Build an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model that can effectively understand the context of Spanish sentences and translate them into clear and coherent English sentences. The company aims to use this model to ensure seamless communication and provide coverage to the Spanish-speaking community in Mexico. In many countries where English is not a very common language for speaking, local traders often need help doing business with merchants from the US or other English-speaking countries.
